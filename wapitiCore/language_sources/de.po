msgid "Blind SQL Injection"
msgstr "Blinde SQL Injektion"

msgid "Blind SQLI"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blind SQL injection is a technique that exploits a vulnerability occurring "
"in the database of an application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This kind of vulnerability is harder to detect than basic SQL injections "
"because no error message will be displayed on the webpage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To protect against SQL injection, user input must not directly be embedded "
"in SQL statements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, user input must be escaped or filtered or parameterized statements "
"must be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Weak credentials"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web application is using either default credentials or weak passwords "
"that can be found in well-known passwords lists."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for admin "
"users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \\r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, "
"\\n)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A CRLF Injection attack occurs when a user manages to submit a CRLF into an "
"application."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is most commonly done by modifying an HTTP parameter or URL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Check the submitted parameters and do not allow CRLF to be injected when it "
"is not expected."
msgstr ""

msgid "Content Security Policy Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "CSP Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to "
"detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting "
"(XSS) and data injection attacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Configuring Content Security Policy involves adding the Content-Security-"
"Policy HTTP header to a web page and giving it values to control what "
"resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross Site Request Forgery"
msgstr ""

msgid "CSRF"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to "
"execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently "
"authenticated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check if your framework has built-in CSRF protection and use it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If framework does not have built-in CSRF protection add CSRF tokens to all "
"state changing requests (requests that cause actions on the site) and "
"validate them on backend."
msgstr ""

msgid "This attack consists in executing system commands on the server."
msgstr ""

msgid "The attacker tries to inject this commands in the request parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prefer working without user input when using file system calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "Path Traversal"
msgstr ""

msgid "This attack is known as Path or Directory Traversal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Its aim is the access to files and directories that are stored outside the "
"web root folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "The attacker tries to explore the directories stored in the web server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use indexes rather than actual portions of file names when templating or "
"using language files (eg: value 5 from the user submission = "
"Czechoslovakian, rather than expecting the user to return 'Czechoslovakian')."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ensure the user cannot supply all parts of the path - surround it with your "
"path code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Validate the user's input by only accepting known good - do not sanitize the "
"data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use chrooted jails and code access policies to restrict where the files can "
"be obtained or saved to."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fingerprint web technology"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The use of a web technology can be deducted due to the presence of its "
"specific fingerprints."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is only for informational purposes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Htaccess Bypass"
msgstr "Htaccess Überwindung"

msgid ""
"Htaccess files are used to restrict access to some files or HTTP method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some case it may be possible to bypass this restriction and access the "
"files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure every HTTP method is forbidden if the credentials are bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "Potentially dangerous file"
msgstr "Möglicherweise gefährliche Datei"

msgid "A file with potential vulnerabilities has been found on the website."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure the script is up-to-date and restrict access to it if possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application "
"accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the "
"request to a URL contained within untrusted input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may "
"successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Force all redirects to first go through a page notifying users that they are "
"going off of your site, and have them click a link to confirm."
msgstr ""

msgid "SQLI"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SQL injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to alter the queries "
"executed on the backend database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An attacker may then be able to extract or modify information stored in the "
"database or even escalate his privileges on the system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Server Side Request Forgery"
msgstr ""

msgid "SSRF"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, "
"publishing data to a URL or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be "
"tampered with."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every URI received by the web application should be checked, especially "
"scheme and hostname. A whitelist should be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross Site Scripting"
msgstr "Cross-Site Scripting"

msgid "XSS"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability "
"typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious "
"web users into the web pages viewed by other users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that "
"the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, "
"form fields, and hidden fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS "
"vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to "
"users in an executable form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks "
"by converting the following characters in all generated output to the "
"appropriate HTML entity encoding:"
msgstr ""

msgid "XML External Entity"
msgstr ""

msgid "XXE"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application "
"that parses XML input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external "
"entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of "
"service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of "
"the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The safest way to prevent XXE is always to disable DTDs (External Entities) "
"completely."
